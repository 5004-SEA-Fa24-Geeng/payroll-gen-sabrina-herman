(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment?
I may have just missed going over the beginning of this assigment when I was sick, but I really appreciated the video in the assignment module that provided a bit of guidance and run through of the code from te last assignment. I see that HW 5-6 includes one, though!
